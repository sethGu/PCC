# PCC
This repository is just the design of the PCC, without detailed codes.   
As the 3rd section of my master project, this is the biggest part of the Citizen-centric Smart Campus. However, it is not done yet.   
The main framework here I use is LNMPR (linux + nginx + mysql + php + redis) with the help of python script of machine learning algorithms.
The interview recording is uploaded, including a video and audio files.

## Matters need attention
I'm still doing this section development. Please follow the correct flow if you want to make citation, as it is one part of my conference paper.
